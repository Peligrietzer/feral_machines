### The Follow-up 

Once the audience has bought into the framing of the conflict as one between
"basic facts" and fanatical ideologues, they are better prepared to swallow the
connotative, "latent" content of the slogans, spoonful by spoonful. The use of
denotationally hollow slogans as false-bottom packages for connoted ideological
content is just the crystallized tip of this rhetorical spear, and it admits of
easy gradation. The same parties will go on to use similar tactics as they
titrate their message into increasingly corrosive content.

Instead of *directly* arguing, for example, against the bodily autonomy of
young, transgender adults -- a message that's perhaps a bit too dissonant with
her public-facing, feminist façade -- Natasha Chart will write that
"[autistic kids don't need masectomies](https://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/04/14/autistic-kids-dont-need-mastectomies/)"
(as if anyone, anywhere, has ever said they did). Here, a few more elements
are thrown into the mix: to a statement that can't be reasonably denied, she
adds another that only a monster would reject.
Who would dare claim that "autistic kids" -- *qua* autistic, and while they're
still kids -- "need masectomies"? The well-known demographic overlap between
autistic and transgender populations is exploited, here, to make it appear as if
*transition*, rather than being a hard-won expression of bodily autonomy on the
part of the transitioner, autistic or otherwise, is being peddled as some absurd
"cure for autism":


> I suspect that getting a mastectomy will not teach one how to make eye
> contact, or not to stare at the details of people’s clothes [1]. I think a
> hysterectomy probably doesn’t help one to gauge an appropriate distance from
> others at which to stand [2], to realize when to stop talking [3], to make easy
> conversation [4], to express appropriate (but not prying) concern for the welfare of
> others [5], to stop answering rhetorical questions literally [6], to spot when others

> or taking advantage [8]. I don’t think that taking cross-sex hormones is likely to

> behaviors you’re meant to respond to with either compliance or resistance [10].

The initial truism, here, which gave Chart her headline, is unfolded into
a series of no-less absurd particulars -- ten, in this one paragraph, by my
count.

This style of progression appears to be typical of reactionary
rhetoric. This is not, as I remember one hearing somebody say of philosophy,
"the process whereby one begins with what is obviously true, and proceeds by
ineluctable steps, to what is obviously false" (I have no memory of who
it was that said this thing, either). The "obvious" content of the slogan isn't taken
as the premise of a rational argument, but as the bait with which the reader is
led down a garden path of increasingly spurious associations. The playbook,
here, is that of the sophist.




(I have a suspicion that it might have been something by &Zcaron;i&zcaron;ek, but I haven't been able to put my finger on it.)
