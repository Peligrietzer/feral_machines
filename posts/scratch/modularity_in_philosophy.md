# Your Rhizome is Unmaintainable

Over a series of emails, my friend Pat McHugh made a few suggestions about
modularity in philosophy, which I've found myself thinking about every now and
then:

> I have an idea that a great philosophy should be somewhat modular; that there
> are ideas which can be applicable and amplified within other systems. That's
> what really keeps these ideas from ossifying. [...] I was once toying with the
> idea of something I called metaphysical modularity, but I don't quite remember
> what the idea was. I think it was something like a group of hypotheses regarding
> some basic ontological features which could provide a regulative nature to a
> number of possible metaphysical or existential commitments without having to
> demand that these larger commitments be the only natural or necessary resultants
> from these hypotheses - they would just help provide a means of testing these
> larger commitments in issues of consistency, verification, justification, or the

It's an idea that will seem intuitively sensible to anyone working in software
engineering, I think. A system that stands or falls as a monolithic whole will, 
under most circumstances, fall. There's a brittleness in holistic unity -- 
subjecting any _part_ of such a system to revision will frequently entail major
or minor revisions in every other component.

# A Grammar of Relationality: Directed Graphs

What monolithism and modularity are describing, here, are different patterns
of connectivity in a system of philosophy. Pat gives the example of the ways
in which our theoretical commitments demand and are entangled with one another,
but we could perhaps generalize this to something like *conceptual dependency*,
where we say that some theoretical construct T is *conceptually dependent* on
another S if we can't make sense of T without already having a conceptual grasp
on T. 

In either case, we seem to be dealing with *transitive*, and, in general,
*directed* relation. If A depends on B, and B depends on C, then A depends
on C as well. And dependence isn't necessarily symmetrical: knowing that A
depends on B doesn't give us any reason to believe that B depends on A.

## Epistemic Consequences of Monolithic Systematicity

## Social Consequences of Monolithic Systematicity

Monolithic unity has sociological consequences for the propagation of a
philosophical system as well. It encourages a certain priestliness in its
carriers. The sheer bulk and holistic complexity of the system means that its
contributions cannot be transmitted piecemeal. The student must _immerse_
themselves within the system, and learn it like they would a language. The
difference between those who _understand_ the system, and those who don't, can't
easily be communicated through discrete arguments, and there's an increased
tendency to rely upon appeals to the authority of the system's priesthood.

A certain degree of epistemic conservativism is to be expected as well, among
the priesthood of monolithic systems. If every component of the system is 
strongly reliant of every other component, then revision is costly, and in 
an effort to ensure only
[minimal mutilation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-underdetermination/)
to the system, there may arise a temptation to 
[disengage](/posts/parasitic_disengagement.md#angels)
from external epistemic challenges.

use that as a foil
