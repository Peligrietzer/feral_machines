In ["Automate the Womb: Ecologies and Technologies of Reproduction"](http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia31/parrhesia31_konior.pdf),
an extended review of both the [Xenofeminist Manifesto](http://laboriacuboniks.net)
and Helen's recently published [Xenofeminism](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Xenofeminism-p-9781509520626),
Bogna M. Konior tempers her praise for both projects with an objection to the way
that, on her reading, we handle the notion of "nature":

> In the manifesto, the concepts of nature and alienation work in tandem
> -- one is discouraged and the other one is applauded. [...][T]he vilified
> 'nature' becomes little more than a strawman, an aestheticised choice
> of machine over flesh that is only valid on terms of its own misdefinition
> of 'nature' as separate from technology. 
> [...]
> [B]oth xenofeminism and ecofeminism perpetuate the nature/technology split,
> while in fact it would be more correct to say that nature grasped properly
> is technology and technology grasped properly is nature. 

There's quite a bit more going on in this review than this. It's an insightful
essay, and well worth the read. But I'm going to pick on this one thread, here.

Konior 

(develop this a bit further, flesh out her argument on this point. maybe
consult her other paper on XF as well.)

It's certainly true that the Manifesto lets loose with a good bit of
Firestonian glee when it comes to 'Nature', and we weren't particularly
careful to preserve an appearance of cautious nuance on this score. 
The eighteenth paragraph of the manifesto is nevertheless relevant here:

> **0x11** Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that
> it cannot be reengineered and transformed so as to widen our aperture of
> freedom, extending to gender and the human. To say that nothing is sacred,
> that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and
> to hack, is to say that nothing is supernatural. 'Nature' -- understood here,
> as the unbounded arena of science -- is all there is. And so, in tearing down
> melancholy and illusion, the unambitious and the non-scaleable, the
> libidinized puritanism of certain online cultures, and Nature as an
> un-remakeable given, we find that **our normative anti-naturalism has pushed
> us towards an unflinching ontological naturalism**. There is nothing, we
> claim, that cannot be studied scientifically and manipulated technologically.

I can't help but wonder what it would actually _mean_ to have nonhuman animals
as "allies". Companions, certainly. But how does one strategize with a dog, exactly?
The notion of "ally", at least by my lights, seems to presuppose sapience, and
at least a discursive community -- it is a joining together of purposes, a
normative bond, a sharing of projects. 

Is the aim here _only_ aesthetic? If so, I don't see a problem, I guess.

Boldface added. We certainly _tried_ to be clear on this point: the distinction
between 'nature' and 'artifice' is absolutely _not_ an ontological one.

No! We never say that "nature" is the _cause_ of _all_ injustice. It is a _means_
for most, but seldom a direct cause. (To be a cause, it must already be charged
with normative force.) "If nature is unjust, change nature!" means to kick out
those aspects of nature that bolster and support injustice. Undermine unjust
power structures.

Ontological turn in anthropology (red flag):

> the ontological turn contests the once dominant view of different cultures as
> simply divergent representations of one, objectively existing Nature. It insists

Desola's "four ontologies": naturalism, animism, totemis, and analogism.

Oddly, there _is_ a point in this essay where Konior addresses paragraph 0x11:

> The engagement with nature as a discursive and geo-located concept is missing
> from the Xenofeminist Manifesto. "We find," it states, "that our normative
> anti-naturalism has pushed us towards an unflinching ontological naturalism.
> There is nothing ... that cannot be studied scientifically." While this

> is the colloquial "natural order of things" that punishes all that is 
> perceived as "unnatural", and the second a rationalist philosophy a la

> of technology and nature through which xenofeminism amasses its accusatory
> and revolutionary capital alike.

I'm a bit lost, here. 

> In other words, the giveness of nature as the realm beyond technology
> is the unexamined condition of xenofeminism, one that prevents it from
> offering a truly inclusive politics for all alienated subjects.

Givenness of nature? What does she mean here, exactly. That we, XFs, 
have fallen prey to the prejudice that nature is "given", prior to our
engagement with it. Directly preceding this section, XF is contrasted
with Haraway's dictum that "the historically specific human relations
with 'nature' must ... be imagined as genuinely social". Is the "givenness"
here meant to indicated a non-social relation with nature?

!!! 

It's clear that we irreconcilably part ways here. 

> Xenofeminism demands: "If nature is unjust, change nature." Perhaps this 
> is not enough -- perhaps if nature is unjust, we need to erase it. 

And here's where we end up. Konior's proposed radicalization of XF is just
its deracination from the actual. Ontological truth is relativized to
culture (or 'natureculture'), literally aestheticized. 

There's an interestingly twofold movement, here: a call to abolish the
_axiological_ separation of artifice from nature
-- where this distinction is, for her, ontological -- coupled with a
call to unify aesthetics and ontology. An absorption of ontology by
aesthetics? An aesthetic ontophagy? 

no. reformulate. 

What is this "separation", to begin with? The XFM is explicit, at least,
on what it is *not*: it is not a distinction between two different kinds
of beings. "Nature is all there is," we say. And, _as_ nature, it is 
subject to scientific exploration and technological modification.
And yet nature -- anthropogenic or otherwise -- cannot provide a direction
to ethics. 

-- maybe some sellars here.

XF grants nature -- again, anthropogenic or otherwise -- its autonomy
from value. And it is by the same lights that ontological truth must
be freed from aesthetic demands. Konior's gesture amounts to the
absorption of the natural by the normative. Our failure to take this
step was not an oversight. Neither our commitment to normative
antinaturalism _nor_ to ontological naturalism was a mistake, and
*both* would be undercut by the absorption of ontology by aesthetics. 

That said, a number of Konior's specific pleas seem entirely sensible.
Greater attention to ecological dynamics and crises, to the lives of
nonhuman organisms -- these do, indeed, deserve close attention.
