What does the phrase "collectively as a society" really do here, besides throw
our basic civic rights to the pits of public opinion? Whose "safety" is really
of concern, here? Why should "cis women, religious women, men, parents, etc."
have a say over fundamental questions of our legal recognition and personhood?
The facade of balanced aloofness falls away from these statement pretty quickly
when I see her, elsewhere, saying things like

> I also care very much about the rights of religious and other women who will
> have spaces taken away from them

 -- "taken away" by the mere fact of not being allowed to exclude *us*. This is
populist collectivism at its most dangerous, to me. And it frightens me to see
it creeping back into respectability, among friends of whom I had naively had
better hopes. It's frightening to think of what would happen to me, and my
family, if this kind of transphobic populism with a human face drowned what few
principled defensed of our rights exist with its appeals to "collective"
decision making. This kind of collectivism is *nothing* but two wolves and a
lamb deciding what to have for dinner.

"Self-identification" is invoked here, as if we're just talking about some
little game of gender-by-fiat. We're just asking for the basic comforts extended
to *anyone* who's socially recognizable as a person, and not abject human
refuse. The alternative to "self-identification" isn't, for us,
good-old-common-sense. It isn't, as Nina puts it, using watchwords that you only
need to google verbatim to see what allegiances they signal,

> the definition of men and women [as] the classical 'adult human male' and
> 'adult human female'

(am I somehow *not* an "adult human female"?); it's coercive identification.
Who, after generations of marginalization, violence, and mockery, should we
trust to "identify" us, if not ourselves? Will cis people -- and cis women, in
particular -- be taken at their word, too, or should they be subjected to the
same "collective" decision process, like Semenya? How brutal and invasive would
this biopolitical machinery need to become before "cis women, religious women,
men, parents, etc." feel "safe" enough about us to just let us live our lives?

So, yes, it's been painful to see Nina drift into this way of thinking, and so
see so many people, who I had just blithely assumed would stand up for my rights
if things continue to get darker, just nod and smile and treat "the transgender
question" as just one more little quibble between comrades, nothing to get all
that heated about.

Maybe I only have my own expectations and naivete to blame. But I'd be
bullshitting if I pretended that the naive little feminist in me doesn't feel
betrayed.

Anyway, I don't put too much stock in the tactic of no-platforming. It's too
easily metabolized into martyrdom, these days, anyhow.

Maybe I should have just spoken to you about this directly, Nina, instead of
stewing over it, these past few months. I guess I just felt a little
intimidated, reluctant to get drawn into a combative situation. Maybe I just
couldn't figure out the social script for something like this. How do you ask
someone who you liked, and respected, and even looked up to, if she has in fact
allied herself with those who would like to see your own abject form morally
mandated out of existence?

It's hard to describe the sense of impending doom that we -- we trans people --
live with, these days. The sense of existential precarity. It feels like we're
hanging on by a thread, which is why even a trivial little shift in the winds
like this one makes us shudder.

0xdeba5e12 [6:20 PM] I feel like I should answer this (pretty shallow) question
that she keeps asking, though: "If a woman is whoever says she's a woman, then
was _this_ the basis for women's oppression through the ages?" i mean, i know i,
and a million other trans women, have answered this in the past, but it does
seem to be a persistent seed of doubt in some quarters, so, why not.

poetix [6:22 PM] It's a reasonably focused question

0xdeba5e12 [6:26 PM] yeah, it kind of rests of a few equivocations, but it seems
like it shouldn't be that hard to clear up. It's really not that hard to take
the full Firestonean account of how and why women have been oppressed on board,
and still be an uncompromising transfeminist. (I like to think Firestone
would've been.) You can say that women have been exploited, primarily, as the
bearers of wombs. But this exploitation was only occasionally explicit and
deliberate, and more often took shape as a tendential and emergent pattern --
modes of behaviour and forms of power were selected for (through broadly
patriarchal pressures, and numerous other contingent factors) to the extent that
they facilitated womb control. You're interpellated as a woman not in virtue of
having a womb, which is mostly invisible, but in virtue of a handful of
contingent features that _happened_ to usually correlate with womb-having.
Sterile women get caught up in that web of power relations, even if they're
false positives from the perspective of deliberate womb control -- but this is
an idealized perspective, and not one that's really all that decisive in the
world, in most contexts. Trans women get caught up in that web for the same
reasons. The fact that the social evolution of that web can't really be
understood apart from womb-control doesn't mean that its local, current effects
hinge on whether their targets actually have exploitable wombs. Anyway, so,
sure, you have this cultural-biological form called "woman", whose contours have
at least partially been given shape through the long, long process of social and
sexual selection that was incentivized to find means of fostering and
controlling reproduction. Once that form exists, nothing really moors it to
bodies-with-wombs though. Womb-control is just one of the selective pressures --
maybe even the most significant one, which we can grant for sake of argument --
responsible for its memetic evolution. But once it's taken shape, it moves
through our wetware more or less on its own. Sometimes it takes root -- imprints
itself on whatever obscure mechanisms are responsible for ego formation -- in
wombless bodies. Sometimes it fails to take root in wombed bodies. These
variations, historically, have tended to be infrequent, and haven't rendered the
memeplex of Womanhood less "fit" (according to the hypothesized incentive of
womb-control) in any significant sense. Now, if you grant that much -- that
Woman is a memeplex, sculpted in part through pressures pertaining to economies
of reproduction -- then deviations are to be expected, and to the extent that
they don't, in themselves, jive with the "patriarchal pressures" that radical
feminism posits to explain Womanhood's historical development, then that's
hardly really a problem for feminism. If anything, you'd want to encourage those
mutations.

puellavulnerata [6:40 PM] (aside - i kinda suspect following this line of
argument buys a few bad premises in the original inquiry: that gender consists
of oppression _and nothing else_, that said oppression is _solely_ connected to
reproductive function (something tells me elliot rodgers wasn't a frustrated
wannabe _dad_...), that the result of being perceived as 'failed woman', i.e.,
not suitable for said reproductive role is not more severe (notice all that red
pill discourse about 'the wall' ?), that the result of being perceived as being
visibly trans is not even worse...)

0xdeba5e12 [6:40 PM] ok, I thought this would be a very pat answer, but now I
realize I can spin up some sort of memetic-historical-materialist framework to
wrangle it. this could get interesting. I'm deliberatingly trying to
_accommodate_ those premises, but they're stronger than I need.

puellavulnerata [6:40 PM] or, i think you're onto something but could stand to
'gendered oppression is solely about reproduction' is too simplistic a model
sure

0xdeba5e12 [6:41 PM] All I need for this account is that reproductive-economic
pressure is _one_ of the factors shaping "Womanhood", as a historical entity.
which, I mean, is probably true

puellavulnerata [6:41 PM] oh, i'll grant that

0xdeba5e12 [6:41 PM] that and a slew of other things but I do think that radical
feminism gets that much right, so long as it doesn't mistake the map for the
territory i'm having a brainfoggy day, so i'm not sure how lucid that all was.
i'll paste it somewhere and work on it later

Dhruv Jain I find it very odd how these people (academics who write on trans
issues, not transpeople) advocate an extreme form of postmodernism that
completely negates the role of biology, but simultaneously completely overlook
the role that the biological sciences play to achieve the kinds of
transformations they valorize. 2 Hide or report this Like · Reply · 1h · Edited

Noel Douglas Noel Douglas Dhruv Jain it’s also incredibly crude thinking,
there’s a dialectical relationship between our biology, our social roles, and

Lucca Fraser Lucca Fraser I find that this "extreme form of postmodernism" most
often appears in the form of strawmen, constructed by those who have already
decided (for whatever reason) that they have issues with the extension of civil
rights to trans people, though it's possible that there are a handful of
academics opportunistically trying to use trans people as mascots for their
half-baked, fashionable-in-the-80s social constructivist theories. Most trans
people, and transfeminist theorists, see a profound continuity between the
struggle for free and accessible abortion and the struggle for free, accessible,
and legally recognized gender transition. Both, at bottom, are matters of bodily
autonomy. And both run up against the same antagonists. 1 Edit or delete this

Lucca Fraser Lucca Fraser And I've said this elsewhere (on this wall, I think),
but the call to recognize self-identification isn't a metaphysical claim, and I
think that confusing it for one is what's led various commentators to see the
trans movement as being wedded to some sort of "postmodernism". The meaning of
all the talk about "self-identification" is strictly political: to say that the
*legal* meaning of gender (to the extent that we're still saddled with one)
should be determined by self-identification means only that it should *not* be
determined coercively. It's not about what gender *is*, but about how it should
be policed: as little as possible.

Martin Murray Lucca Fraser , I don’t quite understand your post, so some (genuine) questions: I don’t myself confuse postmodernism and metaphysics, but if you don’t think sexual identity is at all biological (I don’t know whether this is your view or not), then how is self-ID *not* metaphysical? Are you saying it isn’t because it is political? Do you then think that there’s nothing metaphysical about politics? If so, how could that be the case unless politics was void of ideas?

Lucca Fraser no, you misunderstand what I'm saying here. Personally, yeah, I think that sexual/gender identity is a complex and poorly understood amalgam of biological, social, and psychological factors, that it's multiply realized in various heterogeneous ways, etc. Ontologically, I think it's a mess -- as much as a mess as most other subjective attributes, really. 
The distinction I make between "ontology" and "politics" is at the level of discursive function, not at the level of content, if that helps. When activists say things like "self-identification is the only basis on which gender should be legally assigned", they're not talking about what gender *is* -- we can accept that *that* may just be leaky black box, on which few of us are likely to have any decisive theoretical traction -- but about how people are policed and managed according to gender. That's why it's a political statement, and not a metaphysical or ontological one. 

I'm an abolitionist, myself, so far as the legal category of gender goes. I'd
like to see it dropped from the birth certificates, removed from the letter of
the law, etc. I don't see any reason to let the state, or other apparatuses of
control, get its hooks into us on the basis of the complex stew that makes up
"gender identity" or "sex" or whatever. I think it should be stricken from the
law books, and that urging us to keep it their "for our own protection", or
whatever, is the paternalism pure and simple. There's no reason to give sexism
an explicit foothold in the letter of the law like that. And to the extent that
gender is legally codified, I worry that there will be those of us who fall
outside of its codification, and who are made legally abject as a result.
Pushing for self-identification, politically, doesn't quite accomplish full
legal gender abolitionism, but it's a step in the right direction. Edit or

>  I am not against us collectively as a society deciding that we all want to go for self-identification, or meeting all the demands made by trans activists, but it just seems obvious that while we are working out the best way to ensure that everyone is as safe and recognised as possible, it is important to address everyone’s concerns – cis women, religious women, men, parents, etc. – and to do so together.

the wording of this quote certainly seems to represent “trans activists” as posing our “demands”  from a position completely external to society. also the time of this “while we are working out the best way…” seems potentially interminable. moreover the easy conflation of “classical” and “biological” definitions of gender (as though there were anything classical about biology) reveals that the words she’s looking for is “conventional” and that there is really no thought behind it.

Jackie [12:49 AM]
lucca if I object to one line, it’s your first, where you say you respect her. how?

Jackie [12:56 AM]
but also, I think picking apart someone’s apology can very easily go wrong. no matter how disingenuous or stupid the supposed apology was, your seizing on it will be seized on by a lot of bystanders and perhaps nina to say “see, they’re unappeasable! of course she missed a few steps, she was on her back foot.”

Jackie [1:10 AM]
> Maybe then, too, you’d defer to the wisdom of the crowd, to the concerns of religious communities and patriarchs. Maybe you’d even try to call that “feminism”, too.

regarding feminism and the wisdom of the crowd, I’m not sure why the quotes here. a substantial plurality of feminists have taken utterly horrible positions on race, nation, sexuality, sex work, whatever. in a way, I think the notion that there is some unquoted true feminism is exactly the problem here. nina is not failing to be a feminist, she’s falling into error in a way that many feminists have, and there simply is no feminism nor any other righteousness that can protect you from doing so.
> This is populist collectivism at its most dangerous, to me

I think this would be stronger if you dropped “populist.” she’s an intellectual writing in small circulation, not a spark to tinder. an unsympathetic reader will view the “populist” label as hysterical or equate it to “bolsonarian” or whatever and simply not know what you mean. “populist” is a liberal dirty word right now but who really knows what it means?

your distinction between constitutive and regulative definitions would go a long way here, maybe you can get it to appear earlier that W=AHF, in order to have some language for how that statement is not merely an A=A. I do agree that it’s a bit of transantagonistic fancy footwork but it’s hard to communicate that without giving the appearance of paranoia, or compulsive engagement with the tangential

Jackie [1:46 AM]

Those who would give up essential Gender Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Gender Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety

Peli Grietzer [6:33 AM]
typo: 'no less that' shld be 'no less than'
I think saying that what's being denied by the likes of Nina is the personhood of trans people is, while a popular trope, a bit hard to analytically substantiate? I mean, TERFS think trans women are persons who are male, and should be treated as persons who are male

Peli Grietzer [6:40 AM]
This relates to what's maybe imperfect about the analogy with women's rights and Black civil rights: Nina and her likes don't want trans women to have fewer rights than the social baseline. They want them to have exactly the rights that men have. Like, they hand trans women a perfectly standard package of rights, just not the one trans women want.

poetix [7:08 AM]
I wondered a bit about the line (on FB) you were taking about the complete abolition of gender as a legal category. Nina's argument (in line with a tranche of UK TERFs) has been that the extension of trans rights entails the abridgement of sex-based rights and special protections for women: all-female shortlists for certain representative or leadership positions (NUS Women's Officer, notably), all-female swimming sessions which strictly religious Muslim women can attend (since their religious commitments mean they can't be unclothed to that degree in front of men they're not married to), all-female shelters for victims of male sexual violence and domestic abuse, and so on. The fear is that if someone can self-id as female, without providing any further bona fides, then males will use this to circumvent some necessary male-exclusive boundaries, undermining some of the few protections afforded to women in a sexist society. Now the usual counterpoint is that a) this _never_ (to a first approximation) happens, and it's a paranoid scenario to keep bringing up, and b) men who intend violence towards women don't need to go to such surreal lengths to find opportunities. But if you eliminate the legal signification of gender altogether, then there really is no enforceable way to have all-women shortlists, or anything like that, and that seems like a loss for women, overall, in the present situation.

rhian [7:18 AM]
The distinction should probably be made between "rights" and "permissions by policy". Strictly speaking. men and women have the same rights in all the cases just presented above... but they have very different permissions, implemented as policy by one entity or another.

rhian [7:19 AM]
The TERF position is one of sex separatism, the maintenance of permission boundaries on the basis of sex.
Hence, the inevitably reactionary tilt of what we call TERFism, but really is sort of something else.

poetix [7:34 AM]
I am reasonably happy for there to be women-only domestic violence shelters, given the broadly gendered character of domestic violence and the trauma it induces, but would also hold that "trans women are women" for purposes of that distinction (and others of that kind).

So, for example, if some Muslim women just can't swim in swimming pools where there are men swimming without contravening their religious commitments, then it seems reasonable to accommodate those commitments; but if they insist that no trans women are present, then it seems reasonable to describe this as a violation of others' rights.
(cf arguments about Christian cake shops, etc)

Peli Grietzer [7:37 AM]
@0xdeba5e12 I think it could be good to also post the stuff on gender identification apart from the open letter to Nina. Just as a resource people like me can use I'm the future when explaining/discussing the self-identifcation issue in general

poetix [7:44 AM]
I guess what this comes down to for me is that there's possible split, on these points, along what we might crudely call statist/libertarian lines, which is perhaps orthogonal to the other arguments in play.

rhian [7:51 AM]
@poetix While I agree on the principle of being reasonable with your example (the swimming night), why specifically is it preferable to accommodate Muslim religious commitments than transgender (permissions? inclusions? not sure what the term would be here)?

The answer is, of course, "Muslim women are natal women." So... the physical sex difference, _even if corrected_, is made primary. The reactionary position is default.

rhian [7:54 AM]
This is of course why @0xdeba5e12 used to host trans-friendly swimming. I would ask her if non-trans people were welcome, as long as they kept their shit together. If the answer is yes, then trans people remain in the position of being _always accommodating_.

rhian [7:54 AM]
Which, I don't know... maybe is inevitable and immutable.
Kinda blows.
I'm not an adherent of any religion that makes it incorrect for me to be around any other kind of person, myself... but I can tell you that the reason _I_ don't push those boundaries is because _I'm afraid of them_.
The reactionary position maintains separatism through fear... fear of "us" by basically anyone with any hangup or excuse, fear of "them" by any of us who have to deal with this shit. (edited) 
Not a world-changing proposition, that.

Peli Grietzer [7:59 AM]
I think @poetix wasn't saying Muslim women refusing the presence of trans women in a swimming event seems acceptable to him

rhian [8:00 AM]
I may have misread that, certainly. But I should emphasize that if that is what he was saying, I wasn't disagreeing.
(In the "real world of now" sense)

Peli Grietzer [8:09 AM]
He was saying that Muslim women getting no-men swimming events seems good to him even though Muslim women getting cis-women-only swimming events doesn't. I think he's arguing (contra Lucca's take that trans-inclusive legal gender separation is good mostly because it gets us closer to abolishing legal gender separation)  that allowing for trans-inclusive legal gender separation is in some cases better than abolishing legal gender separation completely.

poetix [8:09 AM]
There is an argument to be made that sex-based permissions, even given an assumed and emphatic "trans women are women" proviso, are always going to end up generating edge cases, and dealing badly with people who occupy marginal positions (Jules Joanne Gleeson tends to wave a flag for intersex or nonbinary people who don't, and/or don't want to, resolve cleanly to a male or female gendered position here)
A lot of how one reasons about this now probably depends on the dependency path one envisages between here and some better future state. I wouldn't abolish legal recognition of gender overnight - I'd want it to be trans-inclusive, and as un-gate-kept as possible, hence supporting the GRA - but I'm open to the argument that it should vanish, over time, from passports and birth certificates, and so on. But that argument would have to be made in a way that considered the present (and probable future) utility of things such as all-female shortlists, and so on.

rhian [8:15 AM]
The idea of "all female shortlists" triggers a train of thought in me which ends for me, at the moment, with "gender cannot be abolished because sex in relation _to anything_ inevitably creates gender."
