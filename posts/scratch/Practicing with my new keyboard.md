# Practicing with my new keyboard
This is really pretty nice, and what a convenient size. 
It would be good if I could find a protective sack for it, before placing it in my satchel. 
I appreciate that the layout and spacing of keys is mostly what my fingers expect, and so touch typing is mostly pretty easy. But I need to figure out how to activate the green symbols.    

Oh, there it is. *The green keycodes are accessed by combining shift + fn1. 	

I think that I have indeed purchased the ideal keyboard for my ipad. It will be perfect for “writing on the go”. And the choice of cherry clear switches means that it will be relatively quiet, while still offering the tactile satisfactions of my clickier keyboards. The resistance is even comparable to my model F, which i guess is what i’m getting used to, now. 

Just be careful not to fuck it up by accidentally programming it to something forgettable. In fact, why program it at all? The defaults seem fine.
