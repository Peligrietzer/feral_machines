## Weird Machines

We're indebted to
[Halvar Flake]()
for putting his finger on _what it is_, exactly, that we're doing when
we're crafting an exploit, and giving a name to the obscure object of
hackers' desire. Exploitation, as he put it, is the setting up, 
instantiation, and programming of a "weird machine".

So, what's a weird machine, then?



The "weird machine" is, perhaps, the principal object of fascination for
hackers -- the structural cause of the desire that drives them.

journalist or media theorist who speaks in hushed tones about "algorithms".

## The Two Cultures

Does the difference between hacker culture and the digital humanities pivot on
their preferred mode of fascination, with respect to the technological world?
Are hackers fascinated by the _weirdness_ lurking within machines, while
media theorists ponder their _eerieness_?
