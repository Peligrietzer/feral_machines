From Mark Wilson's "Can We Trust Logical Form?":

> when the possibility of a doubled grammar looms, the naive counsel "to be
> sound semantically before we go ahead" turns unreliable. In the early stages
> of a doubled language's evolution, linguistic agents will first understand the
> counsel of semantic soundness as an instruction to base inference upon the
> forms approved in *apparent* grammar. Yet inferential practices can claim to
> be genuinely reliable only if they are found in *working* semantics.
> Unfortunately, the exact contours of an appropriate working grammar may not be
> readily apparent; some lengthy measure of preliminary *experimentation* with
> ungrounded inferential procedures may be needed, so that the key inferential
> patterns that *deserve* semantic grounding in working semantics can be smoked
> out. In the interim, as we await that inferential snug harbor, it is often
> wise to ignore premature demands to be "semantically sound". As the robber
