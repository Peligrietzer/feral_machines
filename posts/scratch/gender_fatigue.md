one consequence of the gender theory / trans discourse fatigue that hits pretty
much anyone who transitions, after a few years, together with the exuberant
energy of the freshly declosetted, is that 95% of Trans Discourse is written by
baby transes

it's generally a good thing that all these people are finding ways to articulate
their radically changed experience of the world and themselves, so this isn't a
complaint. but it is something to keep in mind, I think. the Discourse isn't
maintained by those with several years worth of experience, but by freshmen. the
olds just kind of grumble about it on backchannels
