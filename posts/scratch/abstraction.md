# What is an Abstraction?

There are two sides to consider, here. 

## Restricted Mediation

An abstraction (or "abstraction layer") *A* over a system *S* provides a
restricted means of interacting with *S*. It's helpful to conceive of both *S*
and *A* as state machines. Effecting transitions in *A* lets us effect sequences
of transitions in *S* -- but the mapping is not going to be one-to-one.
 
(go into some detail here)

## Multiple Realization and Relative Independence

- the same *A* can be an abstraction over arbitrarily many different *S*
systems, so long as *S* "implements" or "models" *A*. 

## Sohn-Rethel and "Real Abstraction"

- does it fit this general theory of abstraction?
- focus on implementation -- which is what makes it "real" rather than
simply "ideal" abstraction (I suppose, though ideas require no less attention to
implementation than material devices do). 

## Leaks

"Every non-trivial abstraction leaks", reads Spolsky's Law. 

But leaks with respect to *what*? An ideal abstraction? 


## Added Complexity (Frege, Peterson)

What relation, if any, exists between this notion of abstraction (whose roots
can be found in the field of engineering, but which I think is generalizable)
and abstraction in the Fregean sense of seizing a predicate as an object?
