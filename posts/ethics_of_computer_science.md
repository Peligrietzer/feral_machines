0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] an analogy just occurred to me between virtue ethics,
and the approach that SICP argues we should take to programming, where, rather
than trying to solve the problem at hand, you first design a language in which
problems _like_ the one you're interested in can be succinctly formulated and
easily solved. (Grothendieck's parable of the hammer and the sea water has the
same form.)

0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] virtue as a domain specific language for ethical
problems

0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] instead of tackling ethical quandries head on, you
cultivate the virtues that will allow them to be grasped with as much clarity
and nuance and possible, and which will make acting ethically with respect to
them relatively easy

0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] most of the lasting contributions to the art of
programming, too, tend to take the form of identifying virtues and vices.

poetix [2 days ago] "Code smells" are vices rather than bugs as such.

0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] exactly

0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] and the sages of the discipline -- the Knuths, the
Sussmans and Abelsons, the Sergeys -- are very good at preaching virtues

0xdeba5e12 [2 days ago] I mean, Langsec is mostly virtue theoretic

poetix [2 days ago] Somewhere in this there's a good blogpost/paper about "the
_real_ ethics of computer science"
