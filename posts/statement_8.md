1. The world is everything that is the case. 
2. What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts. 
3. The logical picture of the facts is the thought. 
4. The thought is the significant proposition. 
5. Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary
proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
6. The general form of truth-function is: [p,ξ,N(ξ)]. This is the general form
   of proposition.
7. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
8. Whereof one cannot be silent, it follows that there is a danger of bitter
   reprivation, of sorrow and grief, of perishing or wandering through the
   woods. (A loss of quality of a fine bond is both good and bad.)
