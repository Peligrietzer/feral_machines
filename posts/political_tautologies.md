# On the Use of Quasi-Tautologies and Truisms in Political Discourse

Every now and then, I'm reminded of something I must have read
(or heard?) somewhere, concerning the use of tautologies, or near
tautologies, in political rhetoric. For years, I've had some
vague sense that I'd read something *extremely illuminating* on
the subject... somewhere. I've never been able to remember the
source, itself, though. And, come to think of it, my memory of
what that source had actually *said* has faded over the years as well,
so I might as well take a stab at a clean room design on the topic. 


## Examples

Now, my reasons for seeing things this way *may* be an effect of
my rather partisan salience filters, but it seems to me that the
discursive strategy I'm talking about it *principally* employed by
the Right, and specifically by its reactionary tail. 

Some obvious examples:

1. [Men aren't women.](https://www.rt.com/news/444189-twitter-man-woman-ban-pc/)
2. [All lives matter.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter)
3. [France for the French.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/rise-of-marine-le-pen-how-the-far-right-leader-became-a-contender-in-france/article34752498/)
4. [It's okay to be white.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_OK_to_be_white)
5. [Boys will be boys.](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/boys+will+be+boys)

## Effects

These aren't 
[scissor statements](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/),
in Scott Alexander's sense -- statements that strike one side as 
*profoundly, viscerally wrong* and the other as *unquestionably correct*, 
and thereby sow discord. Neither side, I believe, perceives these 
"quasi-tautologies" as *trivially* true. Their proponents and their adversaries
alike know full well that the real content of these slogans has been
studiously drained from the words themselves, and held knowingly in a
strictly contextual reserve. Neither immediate party to the conflict, I
believe, mistakes the semantically hollow flasks that remain for their
hidden partisan content. 

There is an audience, however, who *do*, by design, perceive these slogans as
"trivially true", and it is they who are their target market: those outside
the immediate conflict -- bystanders and "normies". And what do they see?
They see one group trying to defend basic, undeniable truths and common
sense, excruciatingly modest in actual content, and another hysterically
objecting, grinding "logic" and "basic common sense" into dust, and
telling them that they, the audience, they too are culpable should they
believe such pernicious messages as "men aren't women", that "all lives
matter", or that it's even so much as "okay" to be *white*. 

I. Rohl develops this argument convincingly in her Medium post, 
[Put in Some Fucking Effort](https://medium.com/@i_rohl/put-in-some-fucking-effort-c2bf28f25df2):

> In particular, uttering a sentence in response to what someone else has said
> will suggest that one thinks the content of one’s utterance relevant to what
> came before, and so will insinuate whatever auxiliary assumptions would be
> needed to make it relevant. If the structure of the conversation sets up an
> utterance as a refutation or counter-point, the utterance will convey that one
> thinks that it is at odds with with the commitments of one’s interlocutors.
> These considerations allow bad actors to make an utterance that clearly
> communicates hateful or objectionable content, and then use literal paraphrase
> and decontextualization to present themselves as wronged parties condemned for
> defending innocuous or demonstrably true positions. 

The article itself presents an excellent dissection of the use of this strategy
in TERF discourse, with an illuminating detour analysing its analogue in the use
of the "All Lives Matter" slogan. 

### The Follow-up

We could call this divisive effect on the intended -- generally clueless --
audience the strategem's **opening move**.

A secondary effect is that once the audience has bought into the framing
of the conflict as one between "basic facts" and fanatical ideologues, they
are better prepared to swallow the connotative, "latent" content of the
slogans, spoonful by spoonful. The use of denotationally hollow slogans as
false-bottom vessels for connoted ideological content is just the crystallized
tip of this rhetorical spear, and it admits of easy gradation. The same
parties will go on to use similar tactics as they titrate their message into
increasingly corrosive content. 

Instead of *directly* arguing, for example,
against the bodily autonomy of young, transgender adults -- a message a *bit*
too dissonant with her public-facing, feminist façade -- Natasha Chart will
write that 
"[autistic kids don't need masectomies](https://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/04/14/autistic-kids-dont-need-mastectomies/)"
(as if anyone, anywhere, has ever said they did!). Here, a few more elements
are thrown into the mix: rather than frame the matter as one of simple, trivial
logic ("men aren't women"), she bolsters it with appeals to compassion that
only an apparent monster would deny. Who would dare claim that "autistic kids"
-- *qua* autistic, and while they're still kids --
"need masectomies"?! The well-known demographic overlap between autistic and
transgender populations is exploited, here, to make it appear as if
*transition*, rather than being a hard-won expression of bodily autonomy
on the part of the transitioner, autistic or otherwise, is being peddled as
some absurd "cure for autism":


> I suspect that getting a mastectomy will not teach one how to make eye
> contact, or not to stare at the details of people’s clothes [1]. I think a
> hysterectomy probably doesn’t help one to gauge an appropriate distance from
> others at which to stand [2], to realize when to stop talking [3], to make easy
> conversation [4], to express appropriate (but not prying) concern for the welfare of
> others [5], to stop answering rhetorical questions literally [6], to spot when others
> wish to change subjects [7], or to realize quickly when people are making fun of you
> or taking advantage [8]. I don’t think that taking cross-sex hormones is likely to
> help one to understand whose behaviors you’re meant to imitate [9], and whose
> behaviors you’re meant to respond to with either compliance or resistance [10].

The initial truism, here, which gave Chart her headline, is unfolded into
a series of no-less absurd particulars -- ten, in this one paragraph, by my
count.

This style of progression appears to me to be typical of reactionary
rhetoric. This is not, as someone once said of philosophy, "the process
whereby one begins with what is obviously true, and proceeds by ineluctable
steps, to what is obviously false" (I honestly have no memory of who said this).
The "obvious" content of the slogan is not taken as the premise of a rational
argument, but as the bait with one is led down a garden path of increasingly
spurious associations. The playbook, here, is that of the sophist.

## Leftist Variations

Does an analogous strategem have a place on the Left, or is this a strictly
Rightist form of sophistry? (And, if the latter, is this for essential or
accidental reasons?)

One analog that *does* leap to mind is: 

i. [trans women are women](https://www.theroot.com/trans-women-are-women-this-isn-t-a-debate-1793202635)

which certainly has the same logical form as "men aren't women" -- which we 
might even see as its reactionary counterpart. But I think that the analogy
is ultimately superficial. Those who assert this statement generally *do not*
expect immediate, trivial assent outside of a certain ingroup. The rhetorical
power of the statement's tautological *form* is leveraged, here, in order to
bring a certain dissonance to the fore -- in order to make strange the fact
that it needs to be said at all. 

So little can the use of the slogan "trans women are women" count on implicit
acceptance by the outgroup (or, rather, the side-group of bystanders to whom
such slogans are customarily addressed), that it's common to find it defused in
a typically reactionary retreat to "transwomen are transwomen", as Chimamanda
Ngozi Adichie does at around the 3-minute mark of 
[this interview](https://www.channel4.com/news/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-on-feminism):

> so, when people talk about, you know, 'are transwomen _women_?', my feeling is:
> transwomen are transwomen

(Whether Adichie's words should be transcribed as "trans women", or "transwomen",
is up in the air, but I follow Raquel Willis here in using the term that's
customarily, these days, used to _distinguish_ between trans women and women
as disjoint groups, since that appears to be Adichie's intention in this interview.)

### Where a definition is "also a place of struggle"

Appeals to *correctness by definition* are common enough in Leftist discourse,
but the tactics those appeals exhibit appear to be distinct from those we
find animating superficially similar rhetoric on the Right. In most cases,
it's the *explicit content* of the definition that's positioned as the battle
ground (unless the message is intended for the ingroup -- who has accepted the
relevant definitions as axiomatic -- with the aim of keeping them in line). 
When someone asserts, for example, that racism _by definition_ is prejudice
plus power, and that a subjugated race's resentment for its subjugators, in
a given society, cannot meaningfully be called "racism", they's not assuming
that their audience (outside the ingroup) has already accepted this definition.

When Leftists elect to cast their slogans in the _style_ of a tautology, or
an argument from definition, the definition itself tends to be front-loaded
with polemical charge. This is markedly different from the right-populist,
or reactionary, strategy of holding the polemical charge of the slogan in
connotative reserve. The reactionary's audience is not expected to _debate_
whether, in fact, men are actually women, or whether all human lives matter,
or whether it's okay to be white, or whether boys will be what they are.

When appeals to definition are made in Leftist slogans, this is generally 
because they _expect_ definition to be "a place of struggle".

## An Essentially Reactionary Sophism?

The tactic I'm speaking about, here, then, appears to bear an essential
connection to reactionary -- specifically, right-populist -- discourse.
Its charm lies in its appeal to "the way things just _are_", to the 
simple "[facts of the matter](https://thelastinstance.com/posts/facts_are_lazy_and_facts_are_late/)", to "common sense" or "simple logic" -- to the obvious, to
what requires neither criticism nor scrutiny.
