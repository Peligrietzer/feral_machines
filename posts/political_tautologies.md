# On the Use of Quasi-Tautologies and Truisms in Political Discourse

Every now and then, I'm reminded of something I must have read
(or heard?) somewhere, concerning the use of tautologies, or near
tautologies, in political rhetoric. For years, I've had some
vague sense that I'd read something *extremely illuminating* on
the subject... somewhere. I've never been able to remember the
source, itself, though. And, come to think of it, my memory of
what that source had actually *said* has faded over the years as well,
so I might as well take a stab at a clean room design on the topic. 


## Examples

1. [Men aren't women.](https://www.rt.com/news/444189-twitter-man-woman-ban-pc/)
2. [All lives matter.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter)
3. [France for the French.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/rise-of-marine-le-pen-how-the-far-right-leader-became-a-contender-in-france/article34752498/)
4. [It's okay to be white.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_OK_to_be_white)

## Effects

1. The real, affectively charged content is out of band.
2. A challenge looks absurd to an uninformed audience.
3. The obviousness of the manifest content acts as a carrier for
the latent content.
