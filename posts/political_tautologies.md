Every now and then, I'm reminded of something I must have read (or heard?)
somewhere, concerning the use of tautologies, or near tautologies, in political
rhetoric. For years, I've had some vague sense that I'd read something
*extremely illuminating* on the subject... somewhere. I've never been able to
remember the source, itself, though. (I have a suspicion that it might
have been something by &Zcaron;i&zcaron;ek, but I haven't been able to put
my finger on it.) And, come to think of it, my memory of what
that source had actually *said* has faded over the years as well, so I might as
well take a stab at a clean room reconstruction of the topic.


## The Problem

What I have in mind, here, specifically are "trivially true" statements that
are transformed into political slogans. By "trivially true", I mean to include
both statements that wear the syntactic form of a tautology on their surface,
and statements that, in their explicit, manifest content, cleave so closely
to common knowledge that they seem to convey no new information at all --
slogans that appear, for all intents and purposes, semantically vacuous. 

The question I want to ask, then, is: What political function is achieved by
trafficking in "semantically vacuous" slogans?

## Examples

Now, my reasons for seeing things this way might be an effect of
my rather partisan salience filters, but it seems to me that the
discursive strategy I'm talking about is *principally* employed by
the Right, and especially its reactionary tail. 

Some obvious examples:

1. [Men aren't women](https://www.rt.com/news/444189-twitter-man-woman-ban-pc/) -- 
a slogan glibly employed by TERFs and other anti-trans agitators.
1. [Boys will be boys](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/why-boys-will-be-boys-is-an-unscientific-excuse-for-assault) -- 
particularly when used to dismiss concerns about sexual violence.
1. [All lives matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter) -- 
the popular retort by which white supremacists (be they tacit or explicit) most frequently dismiss the eponymous battle cry of the Black Lives Matter movement.
1. [It's okay to be white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_OK_to_be_white) --
the slogan of choice in a recent white supremacist postering campaign.
1. [La France aux Français](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/rise-of-marine-le-pen-how-the-far-right-leader-became-a-contender-in-france/article34752498/) -- a
[perennial](https://www.persee.fr/doc/polit_0032-342x_1993_num_58_3_6289_t1_0810_0000_2) 
rallying cry of French nationalists and xenophobes, whose triviality hinges on
concealing the difference between "those who live in France" and "the French",
but whose virulence depends on exploding it.

## Effects

These aren't 
[scissor statements](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/),
in Scott Alexander's sense -- statements sow discord by striking one group as 
*profoundly, viscerally wrong* and another (which will thereby be christened its
outgroup) as *unquestionably correct*.
Any real locus of disagreement, in fact, is absent from these statements, at
least when taken by the letter -- hence their appearance of being "trivially
true".

The twist, of course, is that neither the slogan's proponents nor its targetted
outgroup, themselves, will in good faith interpret these statements as 
"trivially true" -- otherwise they wouldn't be deployed as slogans. 
Their explicit intent, after all, is divisive. But how can a statement whose
literal content is, if not outright empty, utterly uncontroversial, be used
in this way?

Both the proponents and adversaries of these slogans know full well that their
real content has been studiously drained from the words themselves, only
to be held, knowingly, in a contextual reserve. Neither immediate party to
the conflict mistakes the semantically hollow flasks that become the slogan's
literal form for its hidden partisan content.

Crucially, though, there is an audience who, by design, will perceive these
slogans as "trivially true", and who are, in virtue of that fact, their target
market: those outside the immediate conflict -- bystanders and "normies" -- who
I suppose we could call the "side-group" of the attack, in contrast to its
ingroup and outgroup. 

What does this audience see? They see one group trying to defend basic,
undeniable truths and common sense, excruciatingly modest in actual content, and
another objecting hysterically, grinding "logic" and "basic common sense" into
dust, telling the audience that they too are culpable should they believe such
pernicious messages as "men aren't women", that "all lives matter", or that it's
even so much as "okay" to be *white*.

I. Rohl develops this line of argument convincingly in her Medium post, 
[Put in Some Fucking Effort](https://medium.com/@i_rohl/put-in-some-fucking-effort-c2bf28f25df2),
putting their finger on the manner in which _situating these slogans in a debate_,
itself, is sufficient to infuse them with some of their otherwise absent content:

> In particular, uttering a sentence in response to what someone else has said
> will suggest that one thinks the content of one’s utterance relevant to what
> came before, and so will insinuate whatever auxiliary assumptions would be
> needed to make it relevant. If the structure of the conversation sets up an
> utterance as a refutation or counter-point, the utterance will convey that one
> thinks that it is at odds with with the commitments of one’s interlocutors.
> These considerations allow bad actors to make an utterance that clearly
> communicates hateful or objectionable content, and then use literal paraphrase
> and decontextualization to present themselves as wronged parties condemned for
> defending innocuous or demonstrably true positions. 

The article goes on to present an excellent dissection of how this strategy
is used in TERF discourse, with an illuminating detour analysing its analogue in
the use of the "All Lives Matter" slogan.

### The Follow-up 

Once the audience has bought into the framing of the conflict as one between
"basic facts" and fanatical ideologues, they are better prepared to swallow the
connotative, "latent" content of the slogans, spoonful by spoonful. The use of
denotationally hollow slogans as false-bottom packages for connoted ideological
content is just the crystallized tip of this rhetorical spear, and it admits of
easy gradation. The same parties will go on to use similar tactics as they
titrate their message into increasingly corrosive content.

Instead of *directly* arguing, for example, against the bodily autonomy of
young, transgender adults -- a message that's perhaps a bit too dissonant with
her public-facing, feminist façade -- Natasha Chart will write that
"[autistic kids don't need masectomies](https://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/04/14/autistic-kids-dont-need-mastectomies/)"
(as if anyone, anywhere, has ever said they did). Here, a few more elements
are thrown into the mix: to a statement that can't be reasonably denied, she
adds another that only a monster would reject.
Who would dare claim that "autistic kids" -- *qua* autistic, and while they're
still kids -- "need masectomies"? The well-known demographic overlap between
autistic and transgender populations is exploited, here, to make it appear as if
*transition*, rather than being a hard-won expression of bodily autonomy on the
part of the transitioner, autistic or otherwise, is being peddled as some absurd
"cure for autism":


> I suspect that getting a mastectomy will not teach one how to make eye
> contact, or not to stare at the details of people’s clothes [1]. I think a
> hysterectomy probably doesn’t help one to gauge an appropriate distance from
> others at which to stand [2], to realize when to stop talking [3], to make easy
> conversation [4], to express appropriate (but not prying) concern for the welfare of
> others [5], to stop answering rhetorical questions literally [6], to spot when others
> wish to change subjects [7], or to realize quickly when people are making fun of you
> or taking advantage [8]. I don’t think that taking cross-sex hormones is likely to
> help one to understand whose behaviors you’re meant to imitate [9], and whose
> behaviors you’re meant to respond to with either compliance or resistance [10].

The initial truism, here, which gave Chart her headline, is unfolded into
a series of no-less absurd particulars -- ten, in this one paragraph, by my
count.

This style of progression appears to be typical of reactionary
rhetoric. This is not, as I remember one hearing somebody say of philosophy,
"the process whereby one begins with what is obviously true, and proceeds by
ineluctable steps, to what is obviously false" (I have, again, no memory of who
said this). The "obvious" content of the slogan isn't taken as the premise of a
rational argument, but as the bait with which the reader is led down a garden path of
increasingly spurious associations. The playbook, here, is that of the sophist.

## Leftist Variations

Does an analogous strategem have a place on the Left, or is this a strictly
Rightist form of sophistry? (And, if the latter, is this for essential or
accidental reasons?)

An analog that *does* leap to mind is: 

i. [trans women are women](https://www.theroot.com/trans-women-are-women-this-isn-t-a-debate-1793202635)

which certainly has the same logical form as "men aren't women" (which looks
like its reactionary counterpart), and which has the syntactic form of a
tautology, as much as "red apples are apples" does. But I think that the analogy
is ultimately superficial. Those who assert this statement generally *do not*
expect immediate, trivial assent outside of a certain ingroup. 

When Leftists elect to cast their slogans in the _style_ of a tautology, or
an argument from definition, it's typically the definition _itself_ that's
loaded with polemical charge. The move being made here is less an appeal to
an established definition (be it of "woman", of "racism", or whatever), than
a succinct call to _recast_ the definition at stake.
This is markedly different from the right-populist, or reactionary, tactic,
which holds slogan's charge in connotative reserve. The reactionary's audience
is not expected to _debate_ whether, in fact, men are actually women 
(though they may well dispute the _implicit_ premise that trans women are
actually men!), or whether all human lives matter, or whether it's okay to be
white, or whether boys will be what they are.

So little can the use of the slogan "trans women are women" count on implicit
acceptance by the outgroup (or, rather, the side-group of bystanders to whom
such slogans are customarily addressed), that it's common to find it defused in
a typically reactionary retreat to "transwomen are transwomen", as Chimamanda
Ngozi Adichie does at around the 3-minute mark of 
[this interview](https://www.channel4.com/news/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-on-feminism):

> so, when people talk about, you know, 'are transwomen _women_?', my feeling is:
> transwomen are transwomen

(Whether Adichie's words should be transcribed as "trans women", or "transwomen",
is up in the air, but I follow Raquel Willis here in using the form that's
customarily, these days, used to _distinguish_ between trans women and women
as disjoint groups, since that appears to be Adichie's intention in this interview.)


## An Essentially Reactionary Sophism?

The tactic I'm speaking about, here, then, appears to bear an essential
connection to reactionary -- specifically, right-populist -- discourse.
Its charm lies in its appeal to "the way things just _are_", to the 
simple "[facts of the matter](https://thelastinstance.com/posts/facts_are_lazy_and_facts_are_late/)", to "common sense" or "simple logic" -- to the obvious, to
what requires neither criticism nor scrutiny.
