Every now and then, I'm reminded of something I must have read (or heard?)
somewhere, concerning the use of tautologies, or near tautologies, in political
rhetoric. For years, I've had some vague sense that I'd read something
*extremely illuminating* on the subject... somewhere. I've never been able to
remember the source, itself, though.  And, come to think of it, my memory of what
that source had actually *said* has faded over the years as well, so I might as
well take a stab at a clean room reconstruction of the topic.


## The Problem

What I have in mind, here, specifically are "trivially true" statements
transformed into political slogans. By "trivially true", I mean to include
both statements that, at least on their surface, are clothed in the syntactic
form of a tautology, as well as statements that make a show of cleaving so
closely to common knowledge as to convey no new information at all
-- slogans that, for all intents and purposes, seem semantically vacuous.

The question I want to ask, then, is just: What's the point? What political
function is achieved by trafficking in "semantically vacuous" slogans?

## Examples

Now, my reasons for seeing things this way might be an effect of
my rather partisan salience filters, but it seems to me that the
discursive strategy I'm talking about is *principally* wielded by
the Right, and by its reactionary, populist tail, in particular

A few examples that come to mind are:

1. [Men aren't women](https://www.rt.com/news/444189-twitter-man-woman-ban-pc/) -- 
a slogan glibly employed by TERFs and other anti-trans agitators.
1. [Boys will be boys](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/why-boys-will-be-boys-is-an-unscientific-excuse-for-assault) -- 
when used to dismiss concerns about sexual violence.
1. [All lives matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter) -- 
the popular retort by which white supremacists (be they tacit or explicit) most frequently dismiss the eponymous battle cry of the Black Lives Matter movement.
1. [It's okay to be white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_OK_to_be_white) --
the slogan of choice in a recent white supremacist postering campaign.
1. [La France aux Français](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/rise-of-marine-le-pen-how-the-far-right-leader-became-a-contender-in-france/article34752498/) -- a
[perennial](https://www.persee.fr/doc/polit_0032-342x_1993_num_58_3_6289_t1_0810_0000_2) 
rallying cry of French nationalists and xenophobes, whose triviality hinges on
concealing the difference between "those who live in France" and "the French",
but whose virulence depends on exploding it.

## Effects

These aren't 
[scissor statements](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/),
in Scott Alexander's sense -- statements that sow discord by striking one group
as *profoundly, viscerally wrong* and another (which will thereby be christened
its outgroup) as *unquestionably correct*. These statements are deliberately
void of any genuine locus of disagreement, at least when taken literally. They
are intended, after all, to seem "trivially true".

The twist, of course, is -- otherwise they wouldn't be deployed as slogans. 

Their explicit intent, after all, is divisive. But how can a statement whose
literal content is, if not outright empty, utterly uncontroversial, be used
in this way?

Both the proponents and adversaries of these slogans know full well that their
real content has been studiously drained from the words themselves, only
to be held, knowingly, in a contextual reserve. Neither immediate party to
the conflict mistakes the semantically hollow flasks that become the slogan's
literal form for its hidden partisan content.

Crucially, though, there *is* an audience who will, by design, read these
slogans as "trivially true", and who are, in virtue of that fact, their target
market: those outside the immediate conflict, the bystanders and "normies" --
who I suppose we could call the "side-group" of the attack, to distinguish them
from its ingroup and outgroup.

What does this audience see? They see one group trying to defend basic,
undeniable truths and common sense, excruciatingly modest in actual content, and
another objecting hysterically, grinding "logic" and "basic common sense" into
dust, telling the audience that they too are culpable should they believe such
pernicious messages as "men aren't women", that "all lives matter", or that it's
even so much as "okay" to be *white*.

I. Rohl develops this line of argument convincingly in her Medium post, 
[Put in Some Fucking Effort](https://medium.com/@i_rohl/put-in-some-fucking-effort-c2bf28f25df2),
putting their finger on the manner in which _situating these slogans in a debate_,
itself, is sufficient to infuse them with some of their otherwise absent content:

> In particular, uttering a sentence in response to what someone else has said
> will suggest that one thinks the content of one’s utterance relevant to what
> came before, and so will insinuate whatever auxiliary assumptions would be
> needed to make it relevant. If the structure of the conversation sets up an
> utterance as a refutation or counter-point, the utterance will convey that one
> thinks that it is at odds with with the commitments of one’s interlocutors.
> These considerations allow bad actors to make an utterance that clearly
> communicates hateful or objectionable content, and then use literal paraphrase
> and decontextualization to present themselves as wronged parties condemned for
> defending innocuous or demonstrably true positions. 

The article goes on to present an excellent dissection of how this strategy
is used in TERF discourse, with an illuminating detour analysing its analogue in
the use of the "All Lives Matter" slogan.

## Leftist Variations?

Does an analogous strategem have a place on the Left, or is this a strictly
Rightist form of sophistry? (And, if the latter, is this for essential or
accidental reasons?)

An analog that *does* leap to mind is: 

- [trans women are women](https://www.theroot.com/trans-women-are-women-this-isn-t-a-debate-1793202635)

which certainly has the same logical form as "men aren't women" (which looks
like its reactionary counterpart), and which has the syntactic form of a
tautology, as much as "red apples are apples" does. But I think that the analogy
is ultimately superficial. Those who assert this statement generally *do not*
expect immediate, trivial assent outside of a certain ingroup. 

When Leftists elect to cast their slogans in the _style_ of a tautology, or
an argument from definition, it's typically the definition _itself_ that's
loaded with polemical charge. The move being made here is less an appeal to
an established definition (be it of "woman", of "racism", or whatever), than
a succinct call to _recast_ the definition at stake.

This is markedly different from the right-populist, or reactionary, tactic,
which holds slogan's charge in connotative reserve. The reactionary's audience
is not expected to _debate_ whether, in fact, men are actually women 
(though they may well dispute the _implicit_ premise that trans women are
actually men!), or whether all human lives matter, or whether it's okay to be
white, or whether boys will be what they are.

It's unsurprising that the populist kneejerk against this slogan has, itself,
a way of adopting a tautological form, as it does in the mouth of Chimamanda
Ngozi Adichie, around the 3-minute mark of 
[this interview](https://www.channel4.com/news/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-on-feminism):

> so, when people talk about, you know, 'are transwomen _women_?', my feeling is:
> transwomen are transwomen

(Whether Adichie's words should be transcribed as "trans women", or
"transwomen", is up in the air, but I follow Raquel Willis here in using the
form that's customarily, these days, used to _distinguish_ between trans women
and women as disjoint groups, since that appears to be Adichie's intention in
this interview.)


## An Essentially Reactionary Sophism?

The tactic I'm speaking about, here, then, appears to bear an essential
connection to reactionary -- specifically, right-populist -- discourse.
Its charm lies in its appeal to "the way things just _are_", to the 
simple "[facts of the matter](https://thelastinstance.com/posts/facts_are_lazy_and_facts_are_late/)", to "common sense" or "simple logic" -- to the obvious, to
what requires neither criticism nor scrutiny. 

It's interesting to observe how the formal signature of these slogans, 
alone, is often enough to signal a political kinship across traditionally
dividing lines. In a post on the conservative New Zealand blog, Whale Oil,
entitled
[What Renee Gerlich and Lauren Southern Have in Common](https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2018/09/what-renee-gerlich-and-lauren-southern-have-in-common/), 
we see this played out in some detail. 

It's possible that the capture of right-populist sympathies, I think, is one
of the deliberate aims of this style of rhetoric. The recent uptick in its use,
after all, coincides with the appearance of campaigns like
[Hands Across the Aisle](https://handsacrosstheaislewomen.com), whereby 
"gender critical feminists" make a show of *explicitly* declaring themselves
the allies of the American Right. 

-- more on populism, here. 

The populist fantasy is of a world in which meaning is fundamentally settled.
It's a world that's both entirely assured of its rightness, and perpetually 
under threat.
Populism is a surprisingly stable compound combining uncritical self-assuredness
with an acute fear of persecution.

The tautology and the truism perform a sort of _doubling down_ on meaning.
Thumping the book of The Way Things Are, and insisting that everything 
remain in its place.
