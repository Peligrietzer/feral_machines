1. The original version of _The Office_ was, and remains, one of the greatest
comedies ever made.
2. Its creator, Ricky Gervais, was, and remains, one of the worst stand-up comedians ever
made.

How are we to make sense of this dissonance?

## Broccoli Comedy

I think that one of
[Peli Grietzer's aphorisms](https://www.facebook.com/grietzer/posts/10156948813406383)
sheds some light on what's going on here:

> The only thing I ever, ever want from art is the ability to feel *about* what
> I could previously only feel *in*. Maybe my definition of bad art is 'when the

# Rough Notes

how is The Office such a magnificent work of art, while Gervais' standup comedy is so utterly humourless and boring?

i think the genius of The Office (the UK version) was in its metacomedy. you never laughed at David Brent's jokes directly, you laughed only after the awkward stress of how jarringly _bad_ they were finally broke
most of the time, you laughed just to have some cathartic release from your embarrassment on behalf of all the characters involved. and it was genius, one of the greatest comedies ever made.
Extras was pretty great, too

I think that @Peli Grietzer’s remark about object-vs-meta-level in art applies here:
> The only thing I ever, ever want from art is the ability to feel *about* what I could previously only feel *in*. Maybe my definition of bad art is 'when the object-language and the meta-language are the same'
(citation: https://www.facebook.com/grietzer/posts/10156948813406383) (edited) 

Gervais is somehow one of the world's worst object-level comedians, and one of the world's greatest meta-level comedians
but the curse is that he can only pull this off when he's in character, where he's not obstructed by his own arrogance, but somehow succeeds in making that arrogance an object of ridicule.
Gervais' standup work is unbearable, because it submerses you back _into_ what is only funny from the outside
and so you're about as likely to laugh as the characters in the office were

Contrapoint's video, "The Darkness" got me thinking about this, today

poetix [9:32 AM]
The scene in Extras where Bowie makes up a song, on the spot, about Gervais - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge7S6-Ta3yg - does everything Contrapoints says she wants comedy to do, precisely because it's about, as she puts it, _his_ darkness.
