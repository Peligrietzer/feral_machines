I remembered the anemone: its name, the way that its syllables decay in your
mouth. They're not like the seeds you found in a passerine's beak, the beak of
a nuthatch, for example, pickled and stored in a jar that weeps and weeps
through the label, that sat on a shelf among rows and rows of similar vessels,
each bearing birds or actors to term. The best I can do is delay the (perfectly
crystalline) moment it slips, and is smashed on the asphalt. The jar's pretty
heavy, and my hands, incoherent.

The girl at the desk must've thought we're a couple, so she comped us the double
at no extra cost. I named her Olivia and crawled in her beak, where I curled up
to muffle the syllables. She was a bird, or a mollusc, but I can't quite
remember. I do remember pressing my flesh into curls, which were boneless or
brittle, but I can't remember. Someone recalled pressing the lid from below, 
alveoli held tight by the mason ring.  My hands, at the time, were still
weeping, so the glass and the metal were wet. Back in Spanish, Ontario, just off of Lake
Huron, at the lot where they comped us the double.

I'm able to sleep without falling. My feet end in wires that twist around
branches and keep me in place until New Year's. But you know sleep is coming,
anemone. The first day you bled you were certain. The first day you braided
your hair. Sleep is not a jar. Sleep is the enemy's well-threaded ring.
