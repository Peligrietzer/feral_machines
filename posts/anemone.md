# Lake Huron

I remembered the anemone: its name, the way that its syllables decay in the
mouth. They're not seeds in a passerine's beak -- a nuthatch, for instance,
pickled in formeldehyde, and stored in a jar that weeps through the label.  The
best I can do is delay it, the moment it slips and is smashed on the ashphalt.
The jar's pretty heavy, and my hands, incoherent.

The girl at the desk must've thought we're a couple and gave us the double for
free. I named her Olivia, and crawled in her beak. I curled up to muffle the
syllables. She was a bird, or a mollusc, but I can't remember. I do remember
pressing my flesh into curls, which were boneless or brittle, but I can't
remember. I pressed on the lid from the inside; it was rubberized, ring-locked,
immobile. My hands were still weeping so the glass and the metal were wet. In
Spanish, Ontario, just off of Lake Huron, back at the hotel where we got the
double.

I'm able to sleep without falling. My feet end in wires that twist around
branches and keep me in place until New Year's. But you know sleep is coming,
anemone. The first day you bled you were certain. The first day you braided
your hair. But sleep is not a jar. Sleep is the enemy's well-threaded ring.
