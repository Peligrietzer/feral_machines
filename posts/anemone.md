# Lake Huron

I thought of the anemone, its name, the way that its syllables decay in the
mouth. They're not seeds -- in the beak of a nuthatch, let's say, pickled in
formeldehyde in a jar that weeps till it bleeds through the label.  The best I
can do is delay it -- the moment it slips from my hands and gets smashed into
pieces on ashphalt. I mean, the jar's pretty heavy, and my hands, incoherent.

The girl at the desk must've thought we're a couple and gave us the double for
free. I named her Olivia, and crawled in her beak. I curled up to muffle
the syllables. She was a bird, or a mollusc, I guess, but I can't remember. I
do remember pressing my flesh into curls, which were boneless or brittle, but I
can't remember. I pressed on the lid from the inside; it was rubberized,
ring-locked, immobile. My hands were weeping badly and the glass and the metal
were wet. In Spanish, Ontario, just off of Lake Huron. That's where the hotel
was where we got the double.

I'm able to sleep without falling. My feet end in wires that twist around
branches and keep me in place until New Year's. But you know sleep is coming,
anemone. The first day you bled you were certain. The first day you braided
your hair. But sleep's not a jar. Sleep is the enemy's well-threaded ring.
