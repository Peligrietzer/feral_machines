I remembered the anemone: its name, and the way that its syllables decay in
your mouth. They're not like the seeds in a passerine's beak, the beak of a nuthatch,
for example, pickled and stored in a jar that weeps and weeps through the
label.  The best I can do is delay it, the moment it slips and was smashed on
the ashphalt. The jar's pretty heavy, and my hands, incoherent.

The girl at the desk must've thought we're a couple; she comped us the double
at no extra cost. I named her Olivia and crawled in her beak, where I curled
up to muffle the syllables. She was a bird, or a mollusc, but I can't quite
remember. I do remember pressing my flesh into curls, which were boneless or
brittle, but I can't remember. I pressed on the lid from below; it was
rubberized, ring-locked, immobile. My hands were still weeping, 
so the glass was still wet. Back in Spanish, Ontario, just off of Lake
Huron, at the lot where they comped us the double.

I'm able to sleep without falling. My feet end in wires that twist around
branches and keep me in place until New Year's. But you know sleep is coming,
anemone. The first day you bled you were certain. The first day you braided
your hair. Sleep is not a jar. Sleep is the enemy's well-threaded ring.
