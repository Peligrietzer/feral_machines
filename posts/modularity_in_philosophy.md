# Hegel is Unmaintainable

Over a series of emails, my friend Patrick McHugh made a few suggestions about
modularity in philosophy, which I've found myself thinking about every now and
then:

> I have an idea that a great philosophy should be somewhat modular; that there
> are ideas which can be applicable and amplified within other systems. That's
> what really keeps these ideas from ossifying. [...] I was once toying with the
> idea of something I called metaphysical modularity, but I don't quite remember

> some basic ontological features which could provide a regulative nature to a
> number of possible metaphysical or existential commitments without having to
> demand that these larger commitments be the only natural or necessary resultants
> from these hypotheses - they would just help provide a means of testing these
> larger commitments in issues of consistency, verification, justification, or the
> incorporability of unanticipated data. What any of these basic things would be,
> I do not know, apart from perhaps being some kind of grammar of relationality.

This is something that I don't think I fully appreciated back when I was working
primarily in philosophy. I think that, in hindsight, I took for granted that 
"systematicity" required a monolithic, or "holistic", unity -- that having each
concept in a system draw its significance from each other was not a liability
but a sign of philosophical coherence.
