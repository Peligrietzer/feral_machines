It was a practical, if unorthodox, approach to biography:

the seat becomes smooth
& a mould conceals where the legs enter
cold black pools on felt-tipped toes,
with an octogonal pulp for sitting
-- not frontally,
but diagonally,
informally,
at an angle,
flapping
scissorfish arms at
sleet-bellied fingernail thieves
who catch tingling,
                 chitinous
                 articles,
                                 - 
                                      SQUANDERING
                                      unkelped bones be-
                                      tween senatorial teeth.

Each
of                                        some
your                                      of
jam                                       them
jars                                      victims
contains                                  of
different                                 aerial
finches,                                  raids.
