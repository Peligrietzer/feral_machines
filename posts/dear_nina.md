I respect you, Nina, but I don't want to mince words. I read this as a
statement of mealy mouthed populism at best:

> It seems clear that there are multiple social, philosophical legal and personal
> questions raised by major shifts in how we collectively understand sex, i.e.
> there are things that affect us all if we change the definition of men and women
> from the classical ‘adult human male’ and ‘adult human female’ to mean anyone
> who says they are a man or a woman is a man or woman. It has implications
> backwards (what is women’s history then? Were a number of people treated as a
> class called ‘women’ on the basis of biology or on the basis of how they
> identified?) as well as forwards (what is the future of sex? Will technology
> render biology irrelevant? Will we all be liberated from embodiment? What role
> will drugs and surgery play?). I am not against us collectively as a society
> deciding that we all want to go for self-identification, or meeting all the
> demands made by trans activists, but it just seems obvious that while we are
> working out the best way to ensure that everyone is as safe and recognised as
> possible, it is important to address everyone’s concerns – cis women, religious
> women, men, parents, etc. – and to do so together.


"At best", here, meaning that it's what I'm left with if I overlook such
threadbare transphobic tropes as portraying us as products of shame (for
which any "cure" that doesn't involve us actually asserting bodily autonomy
would be, implicitly, preferable -- this is like asking women to just *accept*
unwanted pregnancies, rather than "mutilate" them), or hinting that a trans
woman like myself is something *other* than an "adult human female" 
([a dog whistle if there ever was one](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22adult+human+female%22)).

## "Collectively, as a society..."


But, sure, for the sake of argument, let's say I'm just seeing faces in clouds
here. Sweep away the flurry of rhetorical questions -- whose function only seems
to be to set up false dilemmas without the need of actually defending them --
and we're still left with bald faced reactionary populism: the autonomy and
dignity of trans people is contingent on the "collective" approval of "society".

What does the phrase "collectively as a society" really do here, besides throw
our basic civic rights to the pits of public opinion? Whose "safety" is really
of concern, here? Why *should* "cis women, religious women, men, parents, etc."
have a say over fundamental questions of our legal recognition and personhood?
The facade of balanced "concern" falls away from these statement pretty quickly
when I see you, elsewhere, saying things like

> I also care very much about the rights of religious and other women who will
> have spaces taken away from them

-- "taken away" by the mere fact of not being allowed to exclude *us*. This is
populist collectivism at its most dangerous, to me. And it frightens me to see
it creeping back into respectability, among friends of whom I had naively had
better hopes. This kind of collectivism is *nothing* but two wolves and a
lamb deciding what to have for dinner.


And appeasing this "collective" is the barrier that you seem to be ready to
throw up before such rudimentary reforms as the GRA deemed acceptable! Could you
even imagine asking this of any other marginalized group? Would you really want
to have been someone, a generation or two ago, who insisted on addressing the
concerns of "white people, religious people, parents, etc" before allowing
people of colour to use public restrooms?

Would you be saying, had you been there at the right time, that we shouldn't
rush into treating women as persons until we had "addressed the concerns" of
men? Would you consider this kind of hesitancy appropriate, given that
recognizing women's personhood would, no less than the current struggle for
trans recognition, require us to "force changes to social and linguistic life"?
(Or should we, even now, make the right to free and safe abortions contingent on
appeasing the "collective concerns" of "religious women, men, parents, etc."?
This certainly seems to be the outlook taken by the terves' newfound allies in
the South.)

Maybe this is just an accident of history, and if you were born a century sooner
you'd be taking the same line on those issues as you are now, with trans rights.
Maybe then, too, you'd defer to the wisdom of the crowd, to the concerns of
religious communities and patriarchs. Maybe you'd even try to call that
"feminism", too.

## "Self-identification"

A lot of fuss has been raised, in these debates, over the question of
"self-identification", without really making clear exactly what's at
stake in this, for us.

It's all very easy to criticize "self-identification" -- especially if you
ontologize it, as something that *constitutes* gender, rather than as something
that just tends to reliably report it as experienced and lived-in-the-world
-- but have you seriously considered what the
alternative amounts to, for us? Or even for cis women like Semenya, for example?
The alternative isn't some pat answer about "biology", because we're not
debating what constitutes gender, but what regulates it, what stitches it into
the fabric of the law. The alternative is *coercive identification*. It's
submitting to identification by others, surrendering your body to *their* wishes
for it, and their fantasies, with no legal leverage to escape it.

And who, after generations of marginalization, violence, and mockery, *should*
we trust to "identify" us, if not ourselves? (Of course, our trust was never
requested in the first place.) How will this "identification" take place? 
How brutal, invasive, or insidious, how tedious and humiliating, will this
biopolitical machinery need to be before "cis women, religious women, men,
parents, etc." feel "safe" enough to just let us live our lives? And how will
this play out for cis women and men? Will they be exempt? How?


The call to recognize self-identification isn't a metaphysical claim at all, I
think, when you get to the root of it, though it's been confused for one often
enough, and this confusion is responsible for the mistaken impression that "the
trans movement" represents -- according to the taste of the critic -- some sort
of "essentialism" (because it seems to rest on a notion of gender as something
adequately known through eidetic intuition, I guess?), "postmodernism" (because
everything that frightens boomers of a certain persuasion is postmodernism, or
because it dispenses with "objective reality"), "subjectivism" (because gender,
on this account, is just a clear and distinct idea) or whatever.

The call to recognize self-identification is a political question, abstracted
away from the opaque and messy biological/psychological/semiotic/social substrate
on which "gender", as a political category, supervenes. It's not about what
gender *is*, but about how it should be policed: **as little as possible**.

What we're dealing with here, in a sense, is what we'd call an "abstraction
layer". The ontological makeup of gender, or what we call gender, is no doubt
messy as hell. It's a leaky black box, equivocally specified and multiply
realized across various heterogeneous materials. I very much doubt that any
account of "gender", adequate to the phenomena we expect it to explain, would
show it to be just "one thing", or cut nature at the joints. But the precise
constitution of that opaque clusterfuck is *irrelevant* to the abstraction at
play. *Whatever one's gender is*, we're saying that its interface with state
power -- to the extent that such a thing is imposed on us -- should be regulated
by personal assent.

This isn't, for many of us, the endgame. We may have our sights set on the
eventual abolition of gender, as a political category. But for this to come
about, I think that we must first refuse, as far as possible, the *coercive*
inscription of that category in our lives.

Peli Grietzer [5:29 PM] one thought about this is that people tend to forget
what an absolute standard, mainstream thing it is to draw political or legal
distinctions in ways that are wrong/arbitrary 'on substance.' like, age limits
on things, or procedures that demand the something known to be true be
disregarded in a trial because the evidence was acquired illegally

0xdeba5e12 [5:29 PM] right, and these aren't necessarily irrational if there are
grounds for drawing a line clearly, and any particular line is bound to be
arbitrary, then there are grounds for drawing a clear line arbitrarily. age of
consent is a great example. i think there might be something somewhere in hegel
about this, iirc and in the case of trial protocols, it is on the whole more
important that the protocols for trials be unambiguous and strict than that they
_always_ be faithful to the truth (edited) at least according to the principles
behind them -- rule of law and all that i like this analogy a lot, actually just
to treat self-identification as a protocol that we can anticipate leading to the
least injustice, and putting that kind of formal simplicity ahead of the issue
of any contingent "false positives" on ethical grounds, because that kind of
formal elegance is a better guard against tyranny than meticulous, fact-checking
accuracy _even if_ you arrived at some fully-trans-activist-approved metric of
"gender accuracy" to work with -- the application of that metric would tend
towards administrative overreach, privacy violation, and oppressive levels of
scrutiny could you imagine having your "lived sense of gender" examined by the
authorities?

Peli Grietzer [5:37 PM] i like this point a lot! that (at least provisionally)
we can expect that any philosophical understanding of gender we might arrive it
would not provide a practical criterion preferable to self identification
